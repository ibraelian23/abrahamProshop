# abrahamProshop
This here is a complete full stack Ecommerce project using JavaScript, React, Redux and MongoDB.
This project here is an implementation of a tutorial series with Brad Traversy as I have learned through his tutorials.
The project is not a replica for the project he made as you can see the only thing similiar is the algorithms used to loop through react elements, and the naming mechanisim to be more organized, other than that all the features added and all the bug fixes was done by me.
Here is the link to the e-commerce webiste created to see the final product => http://abrahamproshopapp.herokuapp.com/
